#---------------------#
# Point-reference data
#---------------------#

# NOAA data are collected at stations that are fixed in space
# initial plots should give an overall spatial variation of the obs
# if there are many time points, only choose a selection of time points for visulaization
# 

Tmax_1 <- subset(Tmax, t %in% c(1, 15, 30))
# choose the 1stï¼Œ 15th, 30th day in Tmax
head(Tmax_1)

             size = 2) +       # enlarge points

# also a good practice to put the spatial location
# of the data into perspective by plotting the boundaries 
# together with the data locations

# above, the US state boundaries are obtained from 
# the maps package through the command map_data("state")
# the boundaries are then overlayed on the plot using geom_path

# projections can be applied by adding another layer to the ggplot2 obj
# using coord_map
# +coord_map(projection = "sinusodal")

# or plot in 3-d projection = "ortho"

# time-series plots
#===================#

# it's recommanded to plot the time seriess
# at all 139 staions
# but here just plot the time series at a set of stations
# selected at random

# 1st obtain a set of unique station identifiers
# choose 10 at random
# and then extract the data associated with these 10 stations from the data set

UIDs <- unique(Tmax$id) # 133
UIDs_sub <- sample(UIDs, 10)

filter # subset a df, retaining all rows satisfy all the conditions
Tmax_sub <- filter(Tmax, id %in% UIDs_sub)


# to visualize the time series at these sub stations
# use facets

# when given a long data frame
# one can first subdivide the df into groups
# and generate a plot for each group


# now plot the time sereise for each selected station
head(Tmax_sub, 2)

# ~id is a formula used to denote the groups we are faceting
# x ~ y can be used to facet by two varaibles

# Hovmoller Plots
#================#

# a two-dim space time visualization, 
# where space is collapsed (projected or averaged)
# onto one dim; the 2nd dim is time

# the Hovmoller plot can be generated easily
# if the data are on space-time grid

# Consider a latitudinal H- plot
# 1st, generate a regular grid of 25 spatial points
# and 100 temporal points using expand.grid function
# with limit set to both the latitude and t limit

lat_t_grid <- expand.grid(lat_axis, t_axis)


# Next, associate each station's latitudal coords with the closest one on the grid
# by finding the distance from the station's latitudinal coords to each point of the grid
# finding which gridpoint is the closest, allocation that to it

# store the grided data in Tmax_grids

Tmax_grid <- Tmax
o <- outer(Tmax$lat, lat_axis, "-") 
# distance from the station's latitudinal coords to each point of grid
# 0 : 20306 by 25

dists <- abs(outer(Tmax$lat, lat_axis, "-"))
dim(dists) # [1] 20306    25

# find the closest grid point for each of the station
m <- apply(dists, 1, which.min) # a vector 20306
all(head(m, 153) == 14) # [1] TRUE
# mean the first 153 stations are all closest to the 14th grid
tail(m)
range(m) # [1]  1 25

min_g <- lat_axis[apply(dists, 1, which.min)]
lat_axis[14] # [1] 39.57222

Tmax_grid$lat <- lat_axis[apply(dists, 1, which.min)]
# the latitude of the grid point closest to each station 

# now have associated each station with closest grid point
# left is to group by latitude and time

Tmax_lat_Hov <- group_by(Tmax_grid, lat, t) %>% summarise(z = mean(z))
# group by lat, t, 
# summarize group by lat, average over time within each lat group

# Note, in this case, every lat-t band consists at least one data point
# so the H plot contains no missing points on the established grid

# if this is not the case, interp from akima package can be used to fill out the
# grid cell with no data
